<h3 align="left">A bit about me</h3>

###

<p align="left">Hey! I'm Lucas. Thanks for dropping by. I love the world of open source, Linux, and I'm constantly pushing to level up my skills. I treat this GitHub as my digital garden-growing my skills in public and connecting with the community.<br><br>Previously, I had the chance to collaborate with my team Gnomon on some cool map for universities<br> solutions.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">What I'm hacking on</h3>

###

<p align="left">I have a few exciting projects cooking in private repositories at the moment. Progress is steady, and I plan to release them as soon as I have a working prototype. For now, they are my personal playground for learning new tech.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">The vibe</h3>

###

<p align="left">Solve problems, listen to Frank Ocean, stay curious as a Brasileiro dev, and enjoy the ride ☕.</p>
